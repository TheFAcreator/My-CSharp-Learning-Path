# My-CSharp-Learning-Path
Some of my favorite C# projects (program tasks are taken from 2 books), created along with my C# learning journey, are in this repository. They have a very simple logic and are in a specific area of knowledge of the programming language.

The total number of projects created using these books is 190. Again, some are pretty simple and short, because they are with an educational purpose. Only a few of them will be included in this repository as some are way too simple.
The 2 books are written by Alexey Vasiliev for learning the basics of C# in examples. Below is the first one (the beginning of my learning path):

10 chapters, at the end of each - 10 project tasks. (I strongly recommend this book for laying the groundwork of your learning.
After reading this book, I continued with the next book:

Extended capabilities of C# in examples. 9 chapters, at the end of each - 10 project tasks. Excellent for giving you a better conception of what the programming language can do.
As said before, I will include only my favorite projects - projects that are slightly more comlex than the other.
